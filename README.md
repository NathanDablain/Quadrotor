Modeling, design, and implementation of an autonomous quadrotor on the AVR128DB48 MCU from Microchip. Consult the Bill of Materials (BOM) within the References folder for a detailed description of components as well as where they can be purchased from. The Ground Controller (GC) was implemented on a Microchip AVR32DA32 MCU, both PCB layouts are contained within the EasyEDA project file within the Electrical folder. The prices included within the BOM for the Flight Controller (FC) and GC PCBs include assembly cost in addition to component and manufacturing cost. Beyond the materials included in the BOM and common hand tools, the following tools are required to make the quadrotor:<br/>
